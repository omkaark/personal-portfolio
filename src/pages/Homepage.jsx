          I wanted to make this website an icon only website, but this was the
          only section I couldnâ€™t include, so I decided to change the UI. This
          website is supposed to track my journey.
          <br />
          <br /> My biggest acheivement for me till now is that I figured out my
          passion. My passion is to build products with use cases, regardless of
          whether it is through product management or software engineering.
          <br />
          <br /> Two ideas that I am big on are Mental Health and Non-profit
          work focused on value creation. I have worked at various non-profits
          and at companies that are focused on mental health!
          <br />
          <br /> This site lays out my product and software experience.
